    <h2>Happy Birthday LOML ðŸ’–</h2>
    <h3>Keep Reading.. â†“</h3>

    <p>Well, I decided not to write an uninteresting long ass message for you, so I made it interesting.
        It's me, I express via writing so how can I skip the writing on your birthday. It's not going to
        be very very long but it's going to tell you a few things that you should know. 
        First and foremost, Happpppyyyy Birthday. OMG, I wish I could celebrate it with you, there are so 
        may things that I wanted to do for you that can only be done in person. But, one day. I am so so 
        so proud of you baby, know that even on the worst days, I will always be there for you. Even though I 
        have only been part of 6 months of your life, just know that in these six months you have shown me how 
        beautiful, intelligent, charming, kind and passionate you are. It's your day, and no matter how the past year
        has been, the present is here, and it's your birthday and you deserve to be happy, you deserve to celebrate living.
        Because I'll be really bummed if you don't make the most out of it, since I'm so far away and can hardly do anything 
        except by gracing you with my presence lol, I want you to celeberate yourself on my behalf. Appreciate yourself,
        pat yourself on the back, get ready, take pictures, send them to me, set goals, and ffs have a sweet little treat.

        Life moves on pretty quickly and later in life I want you to look back and remember each and every birthday 
        of yours by something, like a memory memento and a good one, that you can keep and forever cherish. 
        I will do my best to make a mark each year lol, but for now let it be this tedious, eye-straining message.
        How is sending it on whatsapp fun?? This is much cooler.

        I'm actually really excited that it's your birthday and i get to wish you multiple time (cries in timezone)
        but at the same time, the hope that someday we can do this together, I can do things that may seem extra to you
        on your birthdays, bake you cake, give you thousandsss of kissies and just celebrate you, comforts me. While I
        cannot point the future, I am hopeful, I have you, you have me, we have us, and sometimes that's just enough to 
        keep my hopes sailing. I am not a hopeless romantic, I am a hopeful romantic. Good things happen to those who wait, 
        and heaven knows, all I'm doing is waiting and being hopeful lol. Anyway, about you.
        Things I love about you - Your eyes, your smile, the way you laugh, your goofy actings, your cutu face, your hands omg,
        and you.. I love you and I want to keep on saying it but just like Jane Austen said, if I loved you less, I might be able to
        talk about it more. And even though I know things are not the easiest but just like Murakami said, "Love can rebuild the world, 
        they say, so everything is possible when it comes to love". And just like Rumi said, "Wherever you are, and whatever you do, be in love."
        Life is all about love and I want you to remember that you are loved, deeply. Make sure you feel that feeling today, from the
        people around you and from the universe and from yourself and from me. HEHE. 
        Happy Birthday Baby, have the best day ever. You will never be this young again. Make the most out of it.</p>
